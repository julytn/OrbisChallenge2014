Orbis Challenge 2014
==================
@maxw83 and I built an AI for a classic arcade game, TRON, in 24 hours. Our AI played against other teams to outperform and outlast them. We got a starter package. Our team AI code is [PlayerAI.py](https://github.com/julytn/OrbisChallenge2014/blob/master/tronplayer/PlayerAI.py) under tronplayer.
